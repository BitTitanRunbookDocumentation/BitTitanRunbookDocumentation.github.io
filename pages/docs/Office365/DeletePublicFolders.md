# Office 365
## Delete Public Folders
### SYNOPSIS
```
    Delete Office 365 Public Folders
```
### DESCRIPTION
```
    The task library component deletes public folders from an input list of identities.
    An identity is the full path of the public folder, e.g. "\Test\Directory\My Public Folder".
    To prevent the accidental removal of sub-folders, all sub-folders must be specified in the identity list before the parent folder.
